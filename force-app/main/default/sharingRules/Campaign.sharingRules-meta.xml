        <description>Currently there are sharing rules in place which allow Sales users to add Contacts to Campaigns, where users are assigned the Marketing role are the owners of the Campaign.
However, other users within the Marketing team do not have the Marketing role assigned and are indeed responsible for the creation of Campaigns which need to be editable by the Sales teams.</description>
