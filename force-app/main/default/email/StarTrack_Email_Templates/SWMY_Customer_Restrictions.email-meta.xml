Your supplier allows redirections, redeliveries and depot collection for their consignments, however we are not able to process requests to leave your freight unattended.  
 
We will send your consignment out for redelivery as requested, and if you are not home the driver will leave a card. 

Please call Startrack on 13 23 45 if you would like to make other arrangements. 

Kind regards,
