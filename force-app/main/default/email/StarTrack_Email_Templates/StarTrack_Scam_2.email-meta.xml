Hi 

Thank you for getting in touch with us.

We are aware of a scam text message and email currently circulating asking for payment to receive delivery of a StarTrack consignment.

I can see this article number is not legitimate and is being sent to people as part of a scam we are currently investigating. I can recommend reporting the scam to the ACCC via the SCAMwatch website or by calling SCAMwatch on 1300 795 995.

Please be assured that this matter is currently under investigation, and we ask customers to be vigilant regarding texts, emails and links that are made to look like they come from StarTrack or from Australia Post.


Regards,
