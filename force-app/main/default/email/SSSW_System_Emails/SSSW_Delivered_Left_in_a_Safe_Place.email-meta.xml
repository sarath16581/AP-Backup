Great news {!Contact.FirstName},

Your item {!Case.ReferenceID__c} has been delivered


The parcel you have been waiting for has now been delivered to a safe location at your address, (we call this a “Safe Drop”). {!IF(ISPICKVAL(Case.ProductSubCategory__c, &apos;Registered Post International&apos;),&apos;&apos;,&apos; Check out the tracking here.&apos;)}

To ensure your parcel is safe and sound, our drivers can be pretty creative so here&apos;s a few places that they can use:

Under/inside a car port
Inside a sheltered front veranda or porch
Behind sheltered fixed/solid structures (plant pots and benches are a favourite)
Behind a flyscreen door
Inside a meter box/fuse box
By a side gate

We would recommend you check all of the above locations to locate your item.

You can read more about safe-dropping of items here.

If you have any further questions about the delivery of your item, please reply to this email and we will be happy to assist you.

In the meantime, we will close this enquiry.


Thank you,

Australia Post
