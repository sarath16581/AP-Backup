What happens next?

Most late items arrive within 5 business days of the expected delivery date. If your parcel is delivered, we’ll let you know and close your enquiry.

To allow for delayed delivery, we’ll monitor this delivery until  {!CASE(WEEKDAY(DATEVALUE(Case.Case_Reopen_Date__c)), 1, &quot;Sun&quot;, 2, &quot;Mon&quot;, 3, &quot;Tue&quot;, 4, &quot;Wed&quot;, 5, &quot;Thu&quot;, 6, &quot;Fri&quot;, &quot;Sat&quot;)} 												{!DAY(DATEVALUE(Case.Case_Reopen_Date__c))} 												{!CASE(MONTH(DATEVALUE(Case.Case_Reopen_Date__c)), 1, &quot;Jan&quot;, 2, &quot;Feb&quot;, 3, &quot;Mar&quot;, 4, &quot;Apr&quot;, 5, &quot;May&quot;, 6, &quot;Jun&quot;, 7, &quot;Jul&quot;, 8, &quot;Aug&quot;, 9, &quot;Sep&quot;, 10, &quot;Oct&quot;, 11, &quot;Nov&quot;, &quot;Dec&quot;)}  . If it doesn’t arrive by then, we’ll begin investigating. No need to submit another enquiry.

You&apos;ll hear back from us when we review your enquiry or if your item arrives.

We’ll start our late item investigation 10 business days after the estimated delivery date.

We&apos;re currently experiencing high volumes of enquiries and will be in touch as soon as we can.

If you no longer need us to manage your enquiry, you can cancel it easily by closing your case.
