    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

We&apos;re making it easier to use our Property VOI services with a new portal launching soon. With a single login, you&apos;ll have access to all of our current features in one place:

Access your VOI reports
Generate the latest forms (both reusable and client-specific)
Access our do-it-yourself VOI tool

There&apos;s nothing you need to do
We&apos;ll automatically redirect you from the current login page to the new Property VOI login page once it&apos;s ready, and your login details will remain the same.

Benefits of our Property VOI

Witnessing of Client Authorisation Forms / Land Registry Instruments presented during the VOI – included in your VOI reports
Convenient options – VOI at more than 1,500 participating Post Offices across Australia or conducted by you (using our do-it-yourself VOI tool)
Electronic report delivery – typically within 15 minutes
Your VOI reports all in one place – whether identity checks are completed at a Post Office or by you
Professional indemnity and fidelity insurance (with our in-store service)
