    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We&apos;ve just launched a new portal to make it easier to use our Property VOI services. With a single login, you can access all of our features in one place:

Access your VOI reports
Generate the latest forms (both reusable and client-specific)
Access our do-it-yourself VOI tool

To access the new portal
Bookmark the Property VOI portal at https://auspost.com.au/propertyvoi for future reference. Your login details will remain the same.

Benefits of our Property VOI

Witnessing of Client Authorisation Forms / Land Registry Instruments presented during the VOI – included in your VOI reports
Convenient options – VOI at more than 1,500 participating Post Offices across Australia or conducted by you (using our do-it-yourself VOI tool)
Electronic report delivery – typically within 15 minutes
Your VOI reports all in one place – whether identity checks are completed at a Post Office or by you
Professional indemnity and fidelity insurance (with our in-store service)

Questions?
Email us at LandTitleVOI@auspost.com.au or call us on 1300 364 543.


Kind regards,

Australia Post Property VOI Team</textOnly>
