This is a system-generated email to let you know that your proposal has been reset to ‘draft’, due to a checkout of the shopping cart after the proposal was generated.

To proceed, if you have not done so already, please regenerate your proposal document before continuing with the proposal and agreement processes. This will avoid any future errors.

Further help &amp; support is available through the &apos;Guidance For Success&apos; on the proposal screen</textOnly>
