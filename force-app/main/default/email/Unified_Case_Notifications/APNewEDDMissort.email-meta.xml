A sorting error led to your parcel arriving at a facility outside of your 											area however our team members have already picked up on this and manually 											forwarded it to the correct location.

Errors like this can occur due to damaged or unclear labels and barcodes, or 											automated sorting machines reading the wrong area of the address label. 											Missorts are rare, and are rectified as soon as they are detected. We are 											sorry for the concern this delay may have caused and can assure you that the 											delivery is back on track.

Your case will be closed now that your delivery is on the way. You can 											continue to monitor the tracking for further updates – click here to 											see delivery options and notification preferences for this parcel.
