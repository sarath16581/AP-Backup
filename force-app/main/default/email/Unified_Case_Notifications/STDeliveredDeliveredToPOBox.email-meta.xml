Hi {!IF(ISBLANK(Contact.Preferred_Name__c),Contact.FirstName,Contact.Preferred_Name__c)},

Your delivery has been completed

Thank you for your patience while weâ€™ve been monitoring your delivery. We 											are delighted to see it has now been located and delivered into your PO Box.

If this was too large for a PO box please check the box for a key to collect 											from a locker. If this was sent to your work or other business address 											please check in with the mailroom or building manager to find out about the 											arrangements for mail as it may be collected for you and be received later 											in the day.

The vast majority of Startrack deliveries are completed on time. We&apos;re sorry that on this occasion your delivery was later than expected.
