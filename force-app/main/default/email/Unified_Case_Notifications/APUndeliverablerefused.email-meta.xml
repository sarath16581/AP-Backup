Case {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!IF(ISBLANK(Contact.Preferred_Name__c),Contact.FirstName,Contact.Preferred_Name__c)},

Your delivery was unable to be completed, please contact the sender for a 												resolution

Thank you for your patience while we’ve been monitoring your delivery. We 											now have a tracking update and can recommend some next steps.

It appears that there has been an attempted delivery and someone has refused 											the parcel – this can occur if the address on the label was incorrect or 											damaged and the attempt was at the wrong address. For the safety and 											security of your parcel it will return to the sender to correct this rather 											than risk a misdelivery, so we recommend that you reach out to your sender 											to discuss any next steps. We trust they will be best placed to offer a 											resolution in line with their terms and conditions.
