Hi {!IF(ISBLANK(Contact.Preferred_Name__c),Contact.FirstName,Contact.Preferred_Name__c)},

Your delivery is coming today

Thank you for your patience while we’ve been monitoring your delivery. We 											are delighted to see that it has now been located and is on board to be 											delivered today.

The driver will arrive with your parcel between 1-3pm / by end of day today. 											If you&apos;re not at home, we&apos;ll either leave it in a safe place at the delivery 											address (if the sender hasn&apos;t requested a signature), or you’ll receive a 											card or notification with your delivery options.

Your case will be closed now that your delivery is on the way. You can 											continue to monitor the tracking  for 											further updates.
