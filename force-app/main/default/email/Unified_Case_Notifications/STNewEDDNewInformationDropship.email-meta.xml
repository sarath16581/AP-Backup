Case {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!IF(ISBLANK(Contact.Preferred_Name__c),Contact.FirstName,Contact.Preferred_Name__c)},

Your delivery will arrive shortly

Thank you for your patience while we’ve been monitoring your delivery. We are happy to report that the tracking has updated and you can now expect your delivery on or before {!IF(ISBLANK(Case.EstimatedDelivery__c), '',
											TEXT(DAY(Case.EstimatedDelivery__c)) +" "+
											CASE(
											MONTH(Case.EstimatedDelivery__c),
											1, "January",
											2, "February",
											3, "March",
											4, "April",
											5, "May",
											6, "June",
											7, "July",
											8, "August",
											9, "September",
											10, "October",
											11, "November",
											"December"
											)+" "+TEXT(YEAR(Case.EstimatedDelivery__c)))}.

Where we’d previously calculated the journey of your parcel based on information from the sender, we’ve since received new information about the parcel allowing us to update you with this more accurate delivery estimate. You’ll see more activity on the tracking from here to help reassure that it’ll be with you shortly.

Your case will be closed now that your delivery is on the way. You can 											continue to monitor the tracking for 											further updates.
