Hi {!IF(ISBLANK(Contact.Preferred_Name__c),Contact.FirstName,Contact.Preferred_Name__c)},

Your delivery was unable to be completed, please contact the sender for a 												resolution

Thank you for your patience while we’ve been monitoring your delivery. We 											now have a tracking update and can recommend some next steps.

Your delivery has been located and we can now confirm that it was delivered 											back to the sender. This may have been due to an incorrect or incomplete 											address, a damaged address label, or a request from the sender. We’re unable 											to see the reason however your sender should be able to confirm this with 											you.

As your sender is now in possession of the parcel, please reach out to them 											for assistance.
