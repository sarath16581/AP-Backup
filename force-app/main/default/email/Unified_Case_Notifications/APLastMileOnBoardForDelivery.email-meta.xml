Case {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!IF(ISBLANK(Contact.Preferred_Name__c),Contact.FirstName,Contact.Preferred_Name__c)},

Your delivery is coming today

Thank you for your patience while we’ve been monitoring your delivery. We 											are delighted to see that it has now been located and is with a driver for 											delivery today.

The driver will arrive with your parcel between 1-3pm / by end of day today. 											If you&apos;re not at home, we&apos;ll either leave it in a safe place at the delivery 											address (if the sender hasn&apos;t requested a signature), or it will be taken to 											a Post Office for collection.

Your case will be closed now that your delivery is on the way. You can 											continue to monitor the tracking for further updates – click here to 											see delivery options and notification preferences for this parcel.

Your case will be closed now that your delivery is almost there.
