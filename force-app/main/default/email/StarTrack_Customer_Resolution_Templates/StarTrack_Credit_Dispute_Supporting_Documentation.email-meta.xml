Dear Customer,

Thanks for your enquiry.
In order for us to further investigate your request, we need some documentation from you.

Can you please send through supporting documentation confirming the dead weight and cubic volume for the consignment/s in question?

Examples of supporting documentation could be:
a. A copy of the picking/packing slip
b. Customer invoice/purchase order
c. Photos of the item/s on a scale displaying the weight and or dimensions

In addition to the above, please feel free to send through any other forms of documentation you believe will assist us with our investigation.

NOTE: Please be advised you are now able to lodge your credit claim online by completing our credit claim form via https://forms.startrack.com.au/tools/credit-claim.


Regards,

Customer Resolution Team
