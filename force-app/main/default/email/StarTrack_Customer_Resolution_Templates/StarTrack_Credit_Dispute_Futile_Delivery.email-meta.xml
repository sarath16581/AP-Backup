Dear Customer,

Thank you for your enquiry.

If a second delivery attempt has been made and considered futile (unsuccessful), your account will be charged a fee unless you can provide the Authority to Leave (ATL) barcode number or special instructions enabling the driver to safely leave an item on the delivery premises without needing to obtain a signature.

Please note that units, apartments and shopping complexes are generally deemed unsafe areas to leave an item unattended.

If the first delivery attempt is unsuccessful for a Premium Air service, the item will be taken to the nearest Post Office for collection by the receiver. Your account will incur and additional $8.50 per consignment for this service.

NOTE: Please be advised you are now able to lodge your credit claim online by completing our credit claim form via https://forms.startrack.com.au/tools/credit-claim.

Regards,

Customer Resolution Team
StarTrack
