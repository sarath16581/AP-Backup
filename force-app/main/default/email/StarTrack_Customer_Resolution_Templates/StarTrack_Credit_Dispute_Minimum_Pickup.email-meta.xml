Dear Customer,

Thank you for your enquiry.

Consignment {!Case.ArticleTest__c} has incurred a &apos;single minimum pickup charge&apos;.

If only one consignment is collected from the dispatch point and its total cost of shipping does not meet our minimum charge, your account will incur the minimum required pickup charge.

Please refer to your terms of quotation for more information.

NOTE: Please be advised you are now able to lodge your credit claim online by completing our credit claim form via https://forms.startrack.com.au/tools/credit-claim.


Regards,

Customer Resolution Team
StarTrack
