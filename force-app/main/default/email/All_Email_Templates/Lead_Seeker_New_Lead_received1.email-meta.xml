    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.First_Name_Formula__c},

Thank you for submitting a new business lead.

Your lead is currently being followed-up by our hard working sales team and we’ll keep you informed of its progress. If it reaches the ‘opportunity stage’ of the sales process, you’ll be awarded points!

Don’t forget, the more information you supply with your leads (contact names and details, information about the company, why you think it’s a potential sales opportunity, etc.) the easier it is for our sales team to quickly progress it and the better their chance of success (which means more points for you!).

Thanks again and keep those great leads coming.

Regards,
The Seeker Team
