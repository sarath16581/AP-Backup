    <subject>Seeker Rewards Program – Update on {!Lead.Lead_Number__c} for {!Lead.Company}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.First_Name_Formula__c},

Thank you for submitting a new business lead.

We have been in touch with the potential customer and, at this stage they are only interested in receiving information on our products / services. Because they don’t want to progress any further for now, we’ll ‘close’ the lead. This means that we cannot award you points at this time.

However, we’re keeping your lead on file. So if the customer contacts us in the future to progress with the sales process, you would then be awarded the appropriate value of points.

There’s nothing further you need to do; we’ll be in touch if anything changes.

In the meantime, please remember that every lead is valuable (and could earn you points!). So please keep them coming!

Regards,
The Seeker Team
