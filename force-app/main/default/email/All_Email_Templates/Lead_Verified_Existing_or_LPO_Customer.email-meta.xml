Dear {!Lead.First_Name_Formula__c}

Thanks again for taking part in our Seeker Rewards Program. The lead you submitted progressed to the opportunity stage but unfortunately is not eligible for the program, as it is already an existing customer of Australia Post or an LPO. For more information please login and refer to our terms and conditions.

That means we can&apos;t allocate you any reward points on this occasion, but please do try again. Login to find top tips on how you can seek out future leads and turn them into points to claim great rewards.

We look forward to your participation in the Seeker Rewards Program again soon!

Regards,
The Seeker Team.
