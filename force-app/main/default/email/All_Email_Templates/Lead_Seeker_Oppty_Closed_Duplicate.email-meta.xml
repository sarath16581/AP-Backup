    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Hidden_Lead_Creator_Name__c},

Thank you again for taking part in the Seeker program.

The lead you submitted progressed through our sales process, but unfortunately there was already another submitted before you that our sales team are currently working on. Your lead has now been closed as ‘Duplicate’.

This means you’ll still receive the initial 100 points for the lead being verified. But no further points will be allocated. Please don’t be disheartened, there are leads all around us and you clearly know how to spot them? So please keep them coming for your chance to earn more points.

Thanks again for your participation. Every lead is valuable and we look forward to receiving another lead from you soon.

Regards,
The Seeker Team
