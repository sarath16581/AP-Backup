    <subject>Seeker Rewards Program – Duplicate lead {!Lead.Lead_Number__c} for {!Lead.Company}</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.First_Name_Formula__c},

Thank you for submitting a new business lead.

They say great minds think alike... unfortunately that means one of your equally clever (and speedy!) colleagues spotted the same lead and has already submitted it before you. Your lead has now been closed as ‘Duplicate’.

This means we can’t allocate you any reward points on this occasion. But please don’t be disheartened. There are leads all around us and you clearly know how to spot them! So please keep them coming for your chance to earn points.

Of course if you want any hot tips on hunting down leads, login to the Seeker website and browse the many great resources.

Thanks again for your participation. Every lead is valuable and we look forward to receiving another lead from you soon!

Regards,
The Seeker Team
