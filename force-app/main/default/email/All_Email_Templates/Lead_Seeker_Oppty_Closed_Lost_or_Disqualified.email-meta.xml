    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Hidden_Lead_Creator_Name__c},

Thank you again for taking part in the Seeker program.

The lead you submitted progressed through our sales process and, despite the best efforts of our hard working sales team, unfortunately the outcome wasn’t successful. The lead has therefore been closed as {!Opportunity.StageName}.

You’ve earned points!

In recognition of your great efforts, we’ve awarded you with points (Closed Disqualified – 50 points; Closed Lost – 100 points)!

Have you seen the huge range of rewards?

Make sure you visit the Seeker reward store and check out the amazing range of rewards on offer. There are 4,000+ to choose from, so we know you’ll find something you love.

Congratulations on earning points and don’t forget to keep those fantastic leads coming!

Regards,
The Seeker Team
