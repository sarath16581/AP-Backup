    <textOnly>Thank you for your application for a Salesforce User licence.

To create a new user in Salesforce, we need authorisation and approval for the cost of a licence - $1200 pa – prorata from 1 October each year


We can set up access as soon as we receive:


· Approval from a person with the spend delegation

· The Work Centre Code for the licence to be costed to

· The new user’s APS Number, Team, and Manager


It is also really helpful if you can tell us how you intend to use Salesforce, so we can set up appropriate views and permissions.


Look forward to hearing from you.
