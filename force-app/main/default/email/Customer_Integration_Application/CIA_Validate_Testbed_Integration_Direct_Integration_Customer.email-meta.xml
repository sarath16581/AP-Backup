    <textOnly>Thank you for your recent enquiry into our Australia Post business services.



To gain access to our production Shipping and Tracking APIs we need to validate your integration with the testbed API.



To validate your testbed integration can you please provide:

*         A pdf label that you have generated via the testbed API

*         A pdf Order Summary Report that you have generated via the testbed API.



Once we have received these files, we can validate your integration and provide you access to the production Shipping and Tracking API.

If you have any queries regarding the validation, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at &lt;mailto:customer_connectivity@auspost.com.au&gt; customer_connectivity@auspost.com.au
