Your Reply Paid account has now been cancelled effective immediately.

As your Reply paid account has been cancelled, please stop distributing any remaining envelopes. If we receive any Reply Paid articles, we will hold them at your local Australia Post delivery point for collection and payment. Any additional articles received after two months will incur an underpaid mail fee.

Reply Paid accounts are charged in arrears, not in advance. Any charges applied to your invoice are for the previous yearsâ€™ service. If you have any questions about your invoice, please contact your credit representative listed on your invoice.
		
Kind regards,

Customer Onboarding
