    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Requestor__c}


Please review the attached draft Short Form Operational Doc Attachment B and advise me of any issues. Once you have reviewed the details, please add a new case comment advising of this, tick “Public”, and save the comment. I will then proceed with sending the contract to the customer for signing.


If I do not hear from you by approximately in an hour to advise otherwise, I will continue with sending the contract to the customer.



You can access your case online by following the link below:
