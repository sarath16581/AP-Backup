Hi {!Case.Requestor__c}


Regarding this eParcel contractâ€¦


Xxx LPO has been nominated as a lodgement point, but this outlet is not PCMS enabled.


Please liaise with eParcel Support and the line manager of the LPO to ensure that training is provided on the eParcel system

eParcel Support will need to ensure that training is provided to the line manager of this LPO.
Please follow up with the line manager to ensure that staff in the LPO are trained.


Note that I have overridden this setting to enable entry of rates. This will need to be changed back if this outlet is not going to be trained. If a different lodgement point is required instead, please advise as soon as possible.



Regards
