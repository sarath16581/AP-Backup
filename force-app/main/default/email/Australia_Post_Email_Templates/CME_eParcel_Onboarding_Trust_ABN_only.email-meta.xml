    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Requestor__c}


This customer has given the name of a trust and the accompanying ABN for the trust.


We need more information in order to be able to correctly set up the billing account.


Please provide at least one of the following:

The ACN of the trust – if there is one.
The names of all the trustees. If there is no ACN for the trust, the billing account will be set up in the names of all of the trustees.
The ABN of the Pty Ltd company – if there is one.


Please note that I will not be able to proceed with setting up an account for this customer until we have this information.



You can access your case online by following the link below:
