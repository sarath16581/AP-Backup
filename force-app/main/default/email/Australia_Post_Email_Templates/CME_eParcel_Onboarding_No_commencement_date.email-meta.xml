    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Requestor__c}


I can see that this contract has been signed, but unfortunately I cannot enter the rates into SAP. When you prepared this contract, you did not include a commencement date, which makes the contract invalid according to our legal department.


To correct this error, please send the following paragraph to the customer:


It appears that in error, the contract that we recently signed did not include a commencement date in item 1 of the Details Schedule.


However, the date of the latest signature is recorded as DAY MONTH 2016.  With your consent, I am proposing to insert DAY MONTH 2016 in item 1 of the Details Schedule.


Could you confirm you agree with this approach to correct this error?


Once you receive the customerâ€™s response, please attach it to this case so that I can commence the entry of rates.


You can access your case online by following the link below:
