We can see that your account has been approved and we have sent you an electronic agreement via email from DocuSign.

Please check your inbox for an email from DocuSign with the subject line “Australia Post Request for Customer Signature”. Once we have received notification that you have electronically signed the document we can go ahead and begin on boarding your account.

Once your account has been on boarded you will receive a Welcome Pack which has instructions to finalise your application and start taking payments online.
