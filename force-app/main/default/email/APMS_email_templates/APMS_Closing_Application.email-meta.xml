    <textOnly>Hi {!Application__c.ContactFirstName__c},

Further to our recent email, we have tried unsuccessfully on a number of occasions to contact you via email and phone to assist with getting your Credit card acceptance account Ready to Trade.

As such we have closed your application and removed it from our system.

If you still require an online Credit Card acceptance system, please contact us at your earliest convenience and we can start this process over again.

Regards,

The SecurePay Team
