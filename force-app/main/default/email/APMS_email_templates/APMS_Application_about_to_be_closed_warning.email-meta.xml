    <textOnly>Hi {!Application__c.ContactFirstName__c},

We have tried calling and emailing you a few times but haven’t had any luck so far.

We noticed you set up a SecurePay Online Credit Card Processing account on {!Application__c.CreatedDate} and whilst everything has been approved and set-up information has been sent to you, you are yet to activate your Account.

Can you please call or email us to advise if you still require this service.

If we haven’t heard from you by {!TODAY() + 7} we will assume you no longer need this account and will close it on your behalf.

Regards,

The SecurePay Team
