We’re inviting you to use
Parcel Send

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We previously contacted you about making the switch from your current StarTrack lodgement systems to Parcel Send and the replacement of ‘pre-paid’ services with post-paid services.

We’ve already set up your account, so tap Register now and follow the prompts to start sending.

Once you’ve registered, you’ll still have access to Web Despatch to view Proof of Deliveries (PODs) and obtain pricing estimates until these features are available in Parcel Send.

Note: Make sure you download your consignment history prior to making the switch to Parcel Send.

Claiming credit for my excess ‘prepaid satchels’

If you have any excess satchels, please fill out this form so we can arrange a credit towards your post-paid services.

Once you’ve returned your form, you can start ordering more post-paid satchels using your existing StarTrack consumables website username and password. You can still use your excess satchels with a valid Fixed Price Premium label from Parcel Send.

Return the form by:

email at lodgementmigration@auspost.com.au
fax on 03 9017 1212 or
texting ‘claim’ to 0409 184 735 to either complete the form online or take a photo of your completed physical form and send it to us.
