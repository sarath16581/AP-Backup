Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We recently contacted you about making the switch from Web Despatch to Parcel Send.

We’ve already set up your account, so Log in to Parcel Send now using your existing Australia Post details to start sending.

You’ll still have access to Web Despatch to view Proof of Deliveries (PODs) and obtain pricing estimates until these features are available in Parcel Send.

Visit our website for more information on getting the most out of Parcel Send.

Note: Currently, Parcel Send works best in the following browsers:

Chrome 63
Firefox 57
Safari 11.0.2
