Parcel Send

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We previously contacted you about making the switch from Web Despatch to Parcel Send and the replacement of ‘pre-paid’ services with post-paid services.

We’ve already set up your account, so tap Register now and follow the prompts to start sending.

After you’ve logged in to Parcel Send, you’ll still have access to Web Despatch to view Proof of Deliveries (PODs) until this feature is available in Parcel Send.

Register now
