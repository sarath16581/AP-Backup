We’ve restricted your access
to Web Despatch

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We recently invited you to start using Parcel Send.

We’ve already set up your account, so tap Register now and follow the prompts to start sending.

As of today, you have restricted access to Web Despatch. You can still view Proof of Deliveries (PODs), get your tracking information and obtain pricing estimates but you need to use Parcel Send to create and print labels.

We’ll let you know once these features are available in Parcel Send.

Visit our website for more information on getting the most out of Parcel Send.
