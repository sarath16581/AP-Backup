    <textOnly>Hi LBP Admin team,

There is now a new active Licence record associated to a Network record that has either a Tier 1 or Tier 2 LBP association.

Can you please review the following Licence record and navigate to the associated Network record and update the LBP fields:

Licence Name: {!Account.Name}
Facility Name: {!Account.Facility__c}

Kind Regards,
