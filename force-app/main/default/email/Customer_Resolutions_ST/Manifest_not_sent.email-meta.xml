    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Name__c},

We refer to case {!Case.CaseNumber} for consignment note [...].

Please be advised a credit has been approved.

Moving forward, in order for any unnecessary charges to be applied to your account, an email can be sent to our Connote Deletion Team (connote.deletion@startrack.com.au) by 2 pm each Wednesday, in order for the charge to be removed prior to billing.

Kind regards,
