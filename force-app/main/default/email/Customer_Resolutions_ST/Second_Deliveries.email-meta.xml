    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Name__c},

We refer to case {!Case.CaseNumber} for consignment note [...] in relation to the second delivery charge applied to your account which appears on invoice [...] dated [...].

Attached is the tracking showing that the driver has attempted delivery at  [...] am/pm which is within standard business hours of 9 am to 5 pm.

Based on this information above, the charge appears to be correct.

Kind regards,
