Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

You’ve recently reached out to us regarding an outstanding parcel that was sent to {!Case.Secondary_Contact__c}, a couple days ago we sent you a text message requesting further information and we haven’t heard back from you yet.

If {!Case.Secondary_Contact__c} has advised you that the article has been received, feel free to hit delete on this email.

If this is not the case, given the amount of time that has passed since the article was lodged, and the time since and its last scanning event, we will now be declaring this article lost in transit.

If you wish to continue with the investigation through to its final stage, please reply to this email and your case will be prioritised (contact should be made within 24-48 hours).

Please include the following if they are still outstanding:
