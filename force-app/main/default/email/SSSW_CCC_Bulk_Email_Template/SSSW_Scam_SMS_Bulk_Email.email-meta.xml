Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi,

Thank you for taking the time to contact us about the SMS you received. I&apos;m sure I can help you further. 

Based on the information you have provided I can confirm that the SMS you received is a scam. Australia Post is currently aware of a fraudulent SMS circulating regarding a parcel being held at &quot;Terminal 2&quot; requiring further payment. The SMS will also contain a link which will request you to make a small shipping payment and enter your personal details. Please note that Australia Post will never SMS customers requesting further payment or personal information.

Moving forward, I would suggest that you please disregard and delete the SMS.

If you continue to receive similar messages in the future Iâ€™ve included some tips on how to best deal with them.

- Do not click on any links
- Report any scam emails to Scamwatch at: https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/report-a-scam
- Delete the message upon reporting it to Scamwatch.

Please also be aware that Australia Post will never:
- Email/SMS you to reconfirm your address by clicking a link
- Send you an email/SMS asking for your password, credit card details or account information
- SMS, call or email you unexpectedly to request a payment

Thank you for bringing this to our attention and I do hope that this information has provided some clarity.


Regards,

Australia Post
