Update for Case enquiry - {!Case.CaseNumber}


Thank you for contacting us in relation to the payment/technical issue you experienced on the 29th May 2019.


Sadly, we experienced a system-wide technical error with our SecurePay service provider where this error was identified and a fix was implemented shortly after 10am but it resulted in money being withdrawn from payment accounts and not being transferred to the MyPost Business platform.

We have identified that you&apos;ve made a payment that did not get transferred to MyPost Business and have processed a reversal of this charge back onto your method of payment. You should see this refund appear back on your payment account over the next 1 to 5 business days.

We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by this technical issue and if you continue to experience issues, please reach out to us via Help &amp; Support.

Please enjoy the rest of your week.

Regards,

Australia Post
