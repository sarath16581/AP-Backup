Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the team member responsible for the delivery of this item. They confirmed that your business address has a Post office Box diversion in place. This means that letter and parcel deliveries are delivered to the company’s PO Box, even when addressed to the street address.

We suggest checking your company’s PO Box or speaking to someone familiar with your internal mail arrangements as alternative delivery arrangements such as third-party courier collection can be in place for final delivery to your business address.

If you’re still unable to locate the item, we suggest that you contact the sender to confirm your delivery details.

For future deliveries, you may like to find out about alternative delivery options by visiting https://auspost.com.au/receiving/mypost

Thank you for taking the time to contact Australia Post.

Kind Regards,
