Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the driver responsible for the delivery of this item, however they are unable to recall the specifics of this delivery. They have advised that items delivered to your address are usually placed in the letterbox.

If you are unable to locate the item, the sender will need to contact us, quoting Case {!Case.CaseNumber} so that an investigation can take place.

We hope that this information assists and apologise for any inconvenience.

Kind Regards,
{!User.FirstName}
