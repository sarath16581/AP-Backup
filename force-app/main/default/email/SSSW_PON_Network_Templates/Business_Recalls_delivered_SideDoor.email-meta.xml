Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the team member responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that your item was delivered to the side door of the business address.

If you’re still unable to locate the item, we suggest that you contact the sender to confirm your delivery details.

For future deliveries, you may like to find out about alternative delivery options by visiting https://auspost.com.au/receiving/mypost

Thank you for taking the time to contact Australia Post.
