Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the driver responsible for the delivery of this item, however they are unable to recall the specifics of this delivery. They have suggested that items delivered to your business are usually delivered to authorised building staff or via the dock.

If you’re still unable to locate the item, the sender will need to contact us, quoting Case {!Case.CaseNumber} as evidence that an investigation has taken place.

Thank you for taking the time to contact Australia Post. I hope that this information assists you.

Kind Regards,
{!User.FirstName}
