Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the team member responsible for the delivery of this item and reviewed the route and tracking information. They are unable to recall the specifics of this delivery, but have advised that items delivered to your business are usually delivered to authorised building staff or via the dock.

Thank you for taking the time to contact Australia Post. I hope that this information assists you.

Kind Regards,
