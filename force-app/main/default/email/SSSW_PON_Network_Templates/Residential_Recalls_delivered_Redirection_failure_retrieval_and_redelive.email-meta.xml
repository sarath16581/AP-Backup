Your item is on its way to you.

I have met with the driver responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that your item has been successfully retrieved and has been scheduled for delivery to your redirected address.

Please be advised that steps have been put in place to ensure extra care is taken with future deliveries.

We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused
