Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the driver responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that your item was delivered into a 3rd party locker at the delivery location.

Third-party lockers are parcel lockers that are not managed by Australia Post and may be installed by arrangement at apartment complexes.

If you’re unaware of deliveries to third-party lockers within your apartment complex, we suggest speaking with building management regarding your internal mail arrangements.

For future deliveries, you may like to find out about alternative delivery options by visiting https://auspost.com.au/receiving/mypost

Thanks for taking the time to contact us. I hope that this information assists you.

Kind Regards,
