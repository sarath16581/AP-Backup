Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

Your item is ready for you to collect.

I have met with the driver responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that this item was delivered to an incorrect address. We’ve successfully retrieved this item from that address and it is now available for collection at a nearby Post Office.

Please refer to our website  https://auspost.com.au/track  or mobile app, to find out from the tracking information which post office has the item .

We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause.

Kind Regards,
{!User.FirstName}
