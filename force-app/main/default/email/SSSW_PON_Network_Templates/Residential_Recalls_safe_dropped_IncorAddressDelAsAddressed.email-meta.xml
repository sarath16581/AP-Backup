Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the team member responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that this parcel was delivered to the address on the label.

I encourage you to contact your sender to confirm the address that the item was sent to, and the tracking number they’ve provided.

For future deliveries, you may like to find out about alternative delivery options by visiting https://auspost.com.au/receiving/mypost

Thank you for taking the time to contact Australia Post.

Kind Regards,
