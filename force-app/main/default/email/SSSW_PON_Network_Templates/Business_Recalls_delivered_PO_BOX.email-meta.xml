Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

A mail sorter has advised that your item was delivered into your business PO Box.

We suggest speaking to someone familiar with your internal mail arrangements as alternative delivery arrangements such as third-party courier collection can be in place for final delivery to your business address.

If you’re still unable to locate the item, we suggest that you contact the sender to confirm your delivery details.

Thank you for taking the time to contact Australia Post.

Kind Regards,
