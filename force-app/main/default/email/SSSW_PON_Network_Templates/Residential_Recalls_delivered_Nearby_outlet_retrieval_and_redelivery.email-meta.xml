Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the team member responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they confirmed that your parcel was awaiting collection at a nearby post office. It will be retrieved and delivered to you as soon as possible.

I’m sorry that this delivery didn’t go as planned.

Kind Regards,
{!User.FirstName}
