Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the driver responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that this item was not addressed to you. Please Note: The item was delivered as addressed.

I encourage you to contact the sender to discuss this matter.

Kind Regards,
