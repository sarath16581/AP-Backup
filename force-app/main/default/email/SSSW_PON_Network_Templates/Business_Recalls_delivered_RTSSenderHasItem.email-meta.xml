Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the driver responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that your item was returned to the sender. This can occur when there’s an issue with the address or barcode on the item.

Please contact the sender to discuss the reasons for the return and to re-arrange delivery.

Kind Regards,
