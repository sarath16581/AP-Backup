Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the team member responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that your item was returned and delivered back to the sender. This can occur for a variety of reasons such as an address or barcode issue.

Please contact your sender for further assistance regarding your item.

For future deliveries, you may like to find out about alternative delivery options by visiting https://auspost.com.au/receiving/mypost
