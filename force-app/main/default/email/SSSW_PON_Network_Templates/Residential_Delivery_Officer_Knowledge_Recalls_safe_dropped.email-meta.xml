Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the team member responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that your parcel was ‘safe dropped’ in the following location:

[Location]

What is ‘Safe Drop’?
A ‘Safe Drop’ is when our delivery team member finds a suitable place at your address where they can safely leave an item that does not require a signature.

You can find out more about Safe Drop locations here: https://auspost.com.au/receiving/manage-deliveries-in- transit/leave-in-a-safe-place

If you are still unable to locate your item, we recommend you contact your sender to see if they can assist further.
