Reference {!Case.CaseNumber}

Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the driver responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall delivering the item to the address on the parcel.

As you have suggested you are in a different area, we kindly ask that you contact the sender of your item to confirm that both the address details and the tracking number provided were correct.

We will need to hear from the sender directly that the information provided was correct. Please ask that when contacting us they quote Case {!Case.CaseNumber} as evidence that an investigation has taken place.

Thank you for contacting Australia Post, I hope that this information assists you.

Kind Regards,
{!User.FirstName}
