Update for {!Case.Type} - {!Case.CaseNumber}

Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

We have an update on the delivery of your {!Case.ProductSubCategory__c} item.

I have met with the team member responsible for the delivery of this item, and they have advised that your item was mistakenly delivered to an incorrect address.

They have also advised that your item has since been retrieved and is on track to be delivered to your address.

Tracking updates are available at https://auspost.com.au/track or on our mobile app.

I’m sorry that this delivery did not go as planned.

Kind Regards,
