Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

Your item is on its way to you.

I have met with the driver responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that item has been successfully retrieved and has been scheduled for redelivery to your new business address.

Please be advised that steps have been put in place to ensure extra care is taken with future deliveries.

Thank you for taking the time to contact Australia Post. We apologise for any inconvenience may have caused.

Kind Regards,
{!User.FirstName}
