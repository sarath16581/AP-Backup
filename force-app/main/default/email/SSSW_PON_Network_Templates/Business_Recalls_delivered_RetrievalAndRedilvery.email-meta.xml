Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Re: Article {!Case.ReferenceID__c}

I have met with the team member responsible for the delivery of this item, and after reviewing route and tracking information, they recall that your item was not redirected, but instead delivered to your previous address. We are now attempting to retrieve the item from that address and will deliver it to you as soon as possible.

If you have not received this delivery within three business days, please notify us by replying to this email and we will investigate the situation. For tracking information, please visit https://auspost.com.au/track

Please be advised that steps have been put in place to ensure extra care is taken with future deliveries.

I’m sorry that this delivery did not go as planned.

Kind Regards,
{!User.FirstName}
