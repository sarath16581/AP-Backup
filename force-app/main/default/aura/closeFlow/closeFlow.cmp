	@description This component is created as a work-around solution to close a blank popup after successful navigation(using 'navigateToRecord' aura component), 
				 within a consoled-based app. This is called from a Flow component(e.g. 'STP_Deal_Support_Request_Creation_Organisation').
				 The blank pop-up issue occurs after a release update 'Keep Working with Tab-Focused Dialogs' is enabled
