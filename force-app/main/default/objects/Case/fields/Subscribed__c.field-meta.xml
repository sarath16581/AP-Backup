    <description>This field is set in Case workflow &quot;SSSW - Article Subscription&quot; and will be subsequently unset in code after a job is enqueued to asynchronously set the Article__c.Subscribed__c field. This is only required since the article subscription call is from an outbound message.

At the conclusion of a case update, this field should be set back to False.

Do not use this field for reporting.</description>
