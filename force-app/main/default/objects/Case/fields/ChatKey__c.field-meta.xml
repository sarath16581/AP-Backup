    <description>For live chat engagements when cases are created, this field will store the Chat key of the engaged chat. This is needed since a transcript is not created until AFTER the chat ends, but a case will be created BEFORE the chat ends. The chat key stores a reference and then later links the case to the newly created Transcript record with code.</description>
