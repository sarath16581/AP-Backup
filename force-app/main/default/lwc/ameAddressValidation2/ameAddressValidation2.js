/**
 * @description Integrates with AME address validation API and provides address lookup and validation behaviour. Also allows
 *              capturing the address manually.
 *              This component supports automatically searching AME for an initial search term if supportsAutoSearchOnLoad = true.
 *              Also supports getting the user to confirm the address after selecting from AME or manual entry.
 *
 *              Component publish following events
 *              * selectaddress  - Fired when an address is selected from AME.
 *              * editaddress    - Fired when the address is updated manually.
 *              * confirmaddress - Fired when the address is confirmed.
 *              All three events above include the address as event detail.
 *
 *              NOTE: New component is introduced instead of updating the existing ameAddressValidation1 component so
 *              that there is no impact to the public api exposed by the existing component. This is important to ensure
 *              components that use ameAddressValidation1 continue to function without any change.
